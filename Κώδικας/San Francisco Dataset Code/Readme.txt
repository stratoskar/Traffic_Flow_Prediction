1) In file "Preprocessing-Map Matching San_Fransisco_Taxi.ipynb" we perform preprocessing on the data (data cleaning,
trajectory splitting, map matching, visualization, create SPQ function, comparation python and plpgsql in CPU time, create the
last time_series dataset).

2) This file "San_Fransisco_XGboost_RandomForest_LSTM_Enco-Deco.ipynb", follows the code of file mentioned in (1). Here,
we create the four models for traffic flow prediction. In this research, we use also weather data. 
Visualization tecniques are implemented to understand further the data. 

3) GNN Solution.ipynb contains another traffic flow prediction approach using Graph Neural Networks. Code in this file is 
not done yet.
