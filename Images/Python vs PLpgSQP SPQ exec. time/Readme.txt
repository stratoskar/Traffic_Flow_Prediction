The SPQ function, as detailed in Chapter 4 of the thesis, has been successfully implemented in Python. It's worth noting that the original design of the SPQ function was initially created using PL/PGSQL, a language specific to PostgreSQL. To provide a comprehensive comparison between the two environments, a graph has been generated illustrating the execution times of the identical SPQ function across both Python and PostgreSQL. The x-axis of the graph represents the varying lengths of paths provided as input to the SPQ function, while the y-axis depicts the execution time for each environment, based on a total of 20 function calls. This graphical representation facilitates a clear and insightful analysis of the performance differences between the Python and PostgreSQL implementations. It is important to note that the data used in each SPQ function call are specifically tailored to our research requirements. Consequently, the execution times depicted in the graph solely reflect the performance outcomes observed with our dataset. It's essential to recognize that these results may exhibit variations when applied to different datasets.
