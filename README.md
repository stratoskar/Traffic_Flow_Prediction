# Traffic Flow Forecasting in San Francisco, California

This repository contains my diploma thesis project focused on forecasting traffic flow in paths of San Francisco, California. The goal is to predict how many Taxis will cross a specific Path given historical data. The project utilizes machine learning and deep learning models such as XGBoost, LSTM, Encoder-Decoder, and Random Forest for making accurate forecasts.

## Repository Overview

- **Objective:** Forecast traffic flow in paths of San Francisco, California, using historical data.
- **Methodology:** Time series forecasting using machine and deep learning models. We use the Strict Path Queries paper to measure traffic flow in each path accurately. Read more about SPQ methodology [here](https://www.google.gr/?hl=el)
- **Data:** The dataset consists of paths, each comprising consecutive edges representing road segments between intersections.
- **Models Used:** XGBoost, LSTM, Encoder-Decoder, and Random Forest.
- **Number of Paths:** 1000 paths are used for making traffic forecasts.
- **Approach:** The problem is transformed into time series forecasting, with one time series for each path in the dataset.
