In this directory, you will find all the data that were used in this research. In detail, here are the two traffic flow datasets that were created dynamically after the execution of the code, as well as the weather data that played a crucial role in this thesis. The initial dataset that was used is located inside a zip file. Here is additional information about the data files within this directory:

alldata.zip: contain the GPS information, as well as timestamps and occupied details of each taxi. Each file inside this zip contains the trajectory of only one taxi during May 2008.

"time_series_SPQ.txt": this time series dataset was generated following the execution of the "Notebook1.ipynb" file. It is constructed using the principles of Strict Path Queries (SPQs), ensuring that the data collection process adheres to SPQ methodologies. On the other hand, "time_series_without_SPQ.txt" is a similar time series dataset also resulting from the execution of the "Notebook1.ipynb" file. However, the key distinction is that the traffic flow data in this dataset is gathered without employing the Strict Path Queries methodology.

"weather_data.csv" contains weather-related information for the same time period as the traffic flow data we are using.
