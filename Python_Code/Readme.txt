Within this directory, you will find all the Python code. The code is structured across five distinct Jupyter Notebook files. In each notebook, the code executes specific data analysis operations. The code is enriched with comments, explanations, and visualization graphs (where pertinent) to facilitate a thorough understanding of the operations carried out in each cell.

The first code file is named "Notebook1.ipynb". This notebook includes all the data preprocessing steps. To run this notebook, you should provide the "alldata.zip" from the "Data_Used" folder as input. After executing this notebook, the output files "times_series_SPQ.txt" and "time_series_without_SPQ.txt" are generated (they are located in the "Data_Used" folder).

The second file is named "Notebook2.ipynb". In this notebook, a comparison is conducted between two datasets: "times_series_SPQ.txt" and "time_series_without_SPQ.txt", which are provided as input.

The third file, "Notebook3.ipynb", contains all the machine learning model training and testing processes. Additionally, forecasts are generated using the best model with the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) score identified during the execution of this notebook. To execute the specific notebook file, you need to provide the "weather_data.csv" and "times_series_SPQ.txt" datasets as input. Both files are within "Data_Used" folder. The notebook code will use these datasets for its operations.

The next code file is named "Notebook4.ipynb." Within this Jupyter Notebook file, short-term traffic flow predictions are generated for various paths. The forecasting process utilizes both traffic flow data and weather data. The prediction horizon spans from May 25, 2008, 00:00:00, to May 25, 2008, 09:00:00, providing a 9-hour prediction horizon. Towards the end of the file, there are visualization graphs that display the predicted traffic flow values alongside the previously known values for specific paths.

Last but not least, the "Notebook5.ipynb" code file contains the same code as in Notebook3.ipynb. The only difference here is that the input files we use are the "time_series_without_SPQ.txt" and "weather_data.csv". We are trying to build an XGBoost model, in order to evaluate its performance on traffic flow data that have been created without the use of the SPQ function.
